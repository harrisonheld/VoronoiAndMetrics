# Voronoi And Metrics
This was a short project to explore how different metrics can affect the appearance of a Voronoi diagram.

The two constants at the top, DIRECTORY and FONT_PATH, must be changed to a directory to store images and the file path for a .ttf font file, respectively.

The program will generate 5 images, one for every metric I have included. These have a resolution of 500x500 and have 20 sites, by default. These things can be altered in the parameters of the Voronoi method. The images will be saved to the directory specified.

The Voranoi Program Results folder has 10 images. These are examples of the output of the program.
